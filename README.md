# Heart_Disease_Prediction

Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview:
Preventing heart diseases is of paramount importance. Implementing data-driven systems for heart disease prediction can significantly enhance research and prevention efforts, ultimately contributing to healthier lives. This project harnesses the power of Machine Learning to predict heart diseases with a high degree of accuracy.

## Project Details:

Data Analysis: The project begins with an in-depth analysis of a heart disease patient dataset. Proper data processing is carried out to prepare the data for modeling.

Machine Learning Models: Various machine learning algorithms are employed to make predictions, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression, among others.

Classification Problem: This project revolves around a classification problem. The input features encompass a variety of parameters, and the target variable is binary, indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
K-Nearest Neighbors (Scikit-learn)
Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
Results:
Among the machine learning models used, the Random Forest algorithm achieved an outstanding accuracy rate of 95%. This high accuracy level is a testament to the power of machine learning in predicting heart diseases effectively.
